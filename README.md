snap.svg.andon.js
==============

what is it?
--------------
snap.svg.andon.js is a javascript library based on [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/) that permit to use .svg images files as templates to create web andon/control/scada panels with dynamic text data loaded from a json data source file or page.


Note: the example.html works only on firefox due to the fact that the data is taken from the local DataExample.json file locally (and not from an external url)
